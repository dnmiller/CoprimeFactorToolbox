Coprime Factor Toolbox
======================

Matlab utilities for coprime factor representations of dynamic systems.

Because the Control Systems Toolbox sort of short-changes coprime factor
methods.

Functions include:
- nlcf : Compute normalized left coprime factorization of an LTI system
- nrcf : Compute normalized rght coprime factorization of an LTI system
